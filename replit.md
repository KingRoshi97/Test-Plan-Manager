# Axion Project

## Overview
Axion is a document-generation and compliance-enforcement system with a full-stack web application. It takes intake submissions through a 10-stage Mechanics pipeline (S1_INGEST_NORMALIZE → S10_PACKAGE), resolves standards, builds canonical specs, selects and renders templates, plans work, verifies proofs, runs gates, and packages everything into versioned "kits." The web dashboard provides a UI for creating assemblies, triggering pipeline runs, and browsing artifacts.

## Current State
Full Mechanics pipeline + web application layer with three formal control planes (ICP/KCP/MCP), three agent types (IA/BA/MA), and OpenAI autofill integration. Pipeline: 10 stages, 8 enforced gates (G1–G8), registry-driven engines for all stages, deterministic library loader with pinned versions, proof ledger with evidence policy. Web app: Express API + React dashboard + PostgreSQL database. All stages produce real registry-driven artifacts, all 8 gates pass. Output quality enforcement: 200+ keyword HEADING_DOMAIN_MAP for knowledge bridge, kit bloat elimination (empty slots skipped), deep template completeness gate (18 placeholder patterns), sharpened AI prompts (vague language banned, concrete details required), kit validation on disk, kit packager with SHA-256 manifests.

### Pipeline Stall Detection
Automatic watchdog in `server/pipeline-runner.ts` detects stalled pipeline runs:
- Tracks `lastActivityAt` per running process, updated on every stdout stage-progress line
- 30-second interval checker warns at 5 minutes and kills runs with >10 minutes of inactivity (configurable via `AXION_STALL_TIMEOUT_MS` env var)
- S7_RENDER_DOCS heartbeat logging: per-template start/complete logs and per-LLM-call logs in `evidence.ts`/`filler.ts` keep stall detector alive during long OpenAI batches
- `getPipelineStatus()` returns live status of all running processes
- `GET /api/pipeline/status` endpoint exposes `{assemblyId, runId, currentStage, startTime, lastActivityAt, elapsedMs, stalledMs}` per active run
- UI polling via `App/src/hooks/use-pipeline-status.ts` — shared hook with stall level detection (warning >2min, critical >4min)
- Dashboard, Workbench, and Runs pages show stall warnings, auto-kill countdown, and "Kill Run" buttons

### UI Overhaul — AXION Lab OS (Phases 1–6 Complete)
The web app has been redesigned from a flat dev admin panel to "AXION Lab OS" — a premium dark-mode mission control interface.

**Visual System** (`App/src/index.css`): Obsidian/charcoal dark theme with CSS custom properties for backgrounds, glass panels (backdrop-blur), glow borders (cyan/green/amber/red/violet), status colors (--status-processing, --status-success, --status-warning, --status-failure, --status-intelligence), animation keyframes (pulse-glow, fade-in, slide-in), utility classes (.glass-panel, .glass-panel-solid, .glow-border-*, .premium-card, .nav-item-active, .text-system-label, .font-mono-tech).

**App Shell** (`App/src/components/layout/`):
- `AppShell.tsx` — 3-zone layout wrapper: fixed left sidebar + fixed top command bar + scrollable main canvas
- `Topbar.tsx` — Top command bar with search/command palette trigger (Ctrl+K), active run chip (pulsing cyan when a run is active), environment badge ("Development")
- Sidebar and topbar are position-fixed; content area uses margin offsets via CSS vars (--sidebar-width, --topbar-height)

**Grouped Sidebar** (`App/src/components/app-sidebar.tsx`):
- AXION branding header with gradient AX logo
- 4 collapsible groups: Core Ops (Command Center, New Assembly, Assemblies, Artifacts, Certification), Intelligence (Capabilities, Doc Inventory, Library Control with 15 sub-items), System (Analytics Engine, Health, Logs, Maintenance), Output (Export)
- Library Control label is a clickable nav link → `/library-control` (Library Control Center); chevron toggle separately expands/collapses sub-library list
- Library Control sub-group auto-expands when any library route is active; `/knowledge` also routes to Library Control Center
- Live badge counts (active runs count with cyan badge)
- Active item uses left-border glow via .nav-item-active

**Library Control Center** (`App/src/pages/library-control.tsx`):
- Routes: `/library-control` (primary), `/knowledge` (legacy redirect) — accessed by clicking "Library Control" in sidebar
- Governance-first control surface for all 16 Axion libraries (ops, knowledge, templates, gates, maintenance, policy, telemetry, kit, standards, verification, planning, orchestration, intake, canonical, audit, system)
- 12 sections: Hero Header (control score, governed count, active risks, blocked deps), Estate Status Cards (8 MetricCards with click-to-filter), Control Actions Strip (8 action buttons), Library Health Overview (6 health bands), Library Estate Table (sortable/filterable table with row selection), Selected Library Detail Panel (7 sub-sections), Highest Leverage Fixes (ranked fix cards), Blockers and Risks (two-column), Library Governance Rules (stacked rule cards), Maintenance Modes (9 mode cards), Dependency and Authority Map (link cards), Recent Library Activity (timeline)
- Data: `App/src/data/library-control.ts` — types, helper functions (computeLibraryControlScore, inferControlState, isStale), 16 library records with governance data (authority status, coverage, freshness, integrity, dependency pressure, risk, control state), library details, control actions, health bands, leverage fixes, blockers, risks, governance rules, maintenance modes, dependency links, activity events
- Hook: `App/src/hooks/use-library-control.ts` — filters (query, authority/control/risk filters, stale/blocked/missing-auth/drift toggles, sort), library selection with detail lookup, filter presets (critical-only, unsafe, blocked, stale, drift, missing-authority), updateFilters for bulk filter changes
- Components: `App/src/components/library-control/` — health-overview.tsx, library-estate-table.tsx, library-detail-panel.tsx, maintenance-modes.tsx
- Old Knowledge Dashboard preserved at `App/src/pages/knowledge-dashboard.tsx` but no longer routed as main page

**Premium UI Components** (`App/src/components/ui/`):
- `glass-panel.tsx` — GlassPanel container with configurable glow color (cyan/green/amber/red/violet/none), solid or blur variants
- `metric-card.tsx` — MetricCard stat card with icon, value, label, accent color, optional subtitle and onClick
- `status-chip.tsx` — StatusChip badge with semantic variants (processing/success/warning/failure/intelligence/neutral), optional pulse animation; getStatusVariant() maps assembly status strings
- `stage-rail.tsx` — StageRail horizontal 10-stage pipeline indicator with per-stage tooltips, parseStagesFromAssembly() helper

**Command Center** (`App/src/pages/dashboard.tsx`): Premium mission control dashboard with 4 rows:
- Hero strip: GlassPanel with "AXION Mission Control" title, live StatusChip (LIVE/ATTENTION/ALL CLEAR), environment label, stage/gate summary, "Latest Workbench" + "New Assembly" action buttons
- Row 1: 6 executive MetricCards (Active Assemblies, Failed, Completed Today, Gates, Artifacts Ready, System Health) — all with live data, subtitles, click navigation
- Row 2: 3-column live operations area — Active Operations (running assembly cards with StageRail), Activity Timeline (8 recent events with status icons), Alerts panel (failed assemblies with error messages, badge count)
- Row 3: 6 Command Modules (Start New Assembly, Resume Assembly, Latest Workbench, Review Failures, Artifact Explorer, Maintenance)
- Row 4: Recent Output strip (horizontal scroll of completed assembly cards with preset, duration, verification status, StageRail)
- Fetches `/api/health` for system stats, `/api/assemblies` with 5s polling

**Assemblies Page** (`App/src/pages/assemblies.tsx`): Full fleet management page at `/assemblies` (redirect from `/runs`). Features:
- Header: "Assemblies" title, "Track, organize, and operate all assemblies across the system" subtitle, "New Assembly" CTA
- Primary filter chips: All/Running/Completed/Failed/Queued with live counts
- Secondary filter dropdowns: All Lifecycle (draft/active/in_use/degraded/deprecated/archived), All Families (dynamic + Unassigned), All Owners (dynamic + Unowned)
- Overview cards strip: Total/Running/Failed/In Use/Unowned/Families — clickable to set filters
- Table columns: Assembly (name + idea + preset tag), Status (StatusChip + stall warnings), Family (familyName + familyType), Lifecycle (StatusChip-style badge), Usage (color-coded badge: live/warm/idle/dormant), Owner (ownerName + teamName), Pipeline (StageRail), Elapsed, Duration, Updated, Actions
- Responsive hiding: Family/Lifecycle on md+, Usage/Owner on lg+, Elapsed/Duration/Updated on xl+
- New assembly data model fields: familyId, familyName, familyType, lifecycleState (default "draft"), ownerName, teamName, usageState, lastActivityAt
- PATCH /api/assemblies/:id accepts new metadata fields (familyId, familyName, familyType, lifecycleState, ownerName, teamName, usageState); lastActivityAt is server-managed

**Workbench** (`App/src/pages/assembly.tsx`): Full operational console at `/assembly/:id`:
- Hero header in GlassPanel with project name, StatusChip, run ID badge, duration, action buttons (Run/Stop/Kit)
- Horizontal pipeline strip with S1–S10 rectangular stage nodes, color-coded by status, gate result indicators, clickable to open inspector
- Inspector panel: 320px right-side sticky panel with StageDetailCard (timing, artifacts, notes, gate summary) and GateInspector (checks, evidence, issues, completeness). Selection model: click stage/gate toggles inspector, X closes it. Error states for failed fetches
- Overview tab: contextual status banners (running/failed/completed) in glow GlassPanels, 4 MetricCards (Status/Passed/Failed/Duration), Project Details + Pipeline Status panels, Assembly Metadata panel (inline-editable Family/Lifecycle/Usage/Owner fields via PATCH), token usage display
- Pipeline tab: vertical stage cards with glow borders per status, gate result badges, premium run history table
- Intake tab: section sidebar with nav-item-active pattern, dark-themed form editors, save/re-run actions

- Config tab: assembly config display, JSON viewer, red-glow danger zone
- Build tab: imported BuildTab component with dark-themed state badges, run selector for building from any completed pipeline run (not just the latest)
- Preview tab: `AssemblyPreviewTab` controller (`App/src/components/assembly/AssemblyPreviewTab.tsx`) with 4 child components: `PreviewToolbar` (status badge, device mode toggle, refresh/reload/open/copy actions), `PreviewViewport` (iframe embed with desktop/tablet/mobile widths, reload nonce), `PreviewMetaPanel` (4-section metadata: Source, Preview Target, Timing, Diagnostics), `PreviewStateCard` (9 variants: none/building/preparing/failed/expired/loadError/nonEmbeddable/uncompiled/compiling). Backend: `GET /api/assemblies/:id/preview` (status resolution with dist/ detection and compile status), `POST /api/assemblies/:id/preview/refresh`, `POST /api/assemblies/:id/preview/compile` (triggers npm install + vite build), `GET /api/preview/:runId/_overview` (project overview page), `GET /api/preview/:runId/*` (static file serve from build repo, prefers dist/). Polls at 2s when building/preparing/compiling. On-demand compilation: `server/preview-compiler.ts` (spawns npm install + npx vite build, 5-min timeout, tracks status per runId, pre-build: prunes non-essential devDependencies to avoid stale package resolution failures, detects missing PostCSS plugin deps from config files, injects entry script tag into index.html if missing); `server/preview-overview.ts` (generates dark-theme HTML overview with project name, tech stack, file tree, components list, verification status, Compile & Preview button via postMessage, all dynamic content HTML-escaped for XSS prevention). Status flow: check dist/ first (compiled) → check compilation status → check index.html for script tags → detect package.json (uncompiled) → none. Uses GlassPanel/StatusChip design system.

**Dark Theme Harmonization**: All pages swept for light-mode remnants — health.tsx, features.tsx, feature-detail.tsx, export.tsx, logs.tsx, maintenance.tsx, pipeline-progress.tsx, intake-wizard.tsx, build-mode.tsx, intake form pages, orchestration-library.tsx, system-library.tsx all updated to use dark-appropriate color references.

- `StageDetailCard.tsx` — Stage detail card for inspector: status, timing, consumed/produced artifacts, notes (supports both severity/level fields), gate summary with check pass/fail counts
- `GateInspector.tsx` — Gate inspection panel: verdict chip, checks table with evidence links, issues with severity/remediation, evidence completeness (satisfied/missing proof types), engine info

**API Endpoints** (Phase 3): `GET /api/assemblies/:id/stages/:stageKey` (reads stage report JSON, falls back to normalized run.stages data), `GET /api/assemblies/:id/gates/:gateId` (reads gate report JSON, falls back to reports table). Both log parse errors and return 500 for malformed files.

**CSS Utilities** (Phase 4): `.scrollbar-thin` (thin styled scrollbar for dark theme)

**Phase 5 — Artifacts Explorer**:
- `App/src/pages/files.tsx` — Premium 3-panel artifact explorer: left tree sidebar (250px, collapsible dirs, search, file size), center preview pane (CodeViewer with syntax highlighting), right metadata panel (260px, toggleable, shows artifact_id, type badge, SHA-256, timestamp, producer stage)

**Phase 6 — System Surfaces (Health/Logs/Maintenance)**:
- `App/src/pages/health.tsx` — Premium system health dashboard: hero strip with "Operational" status + engine version + total runs + audit entries, 6 MetricCards (stages, gates, knowledge, templates, runs, audit log), 7-library health grid (system/orchestration/gates/policy/intake/canonical/standards with docs/schemas/registries counts and highlights), recent runs strip, feature packs summary
- `App/src/pages/logs.tsx` — Operations Log with two tabs: "Run Log" (premium table with StatusChip, filter pills, clickable rows → workbench) and "Audit Trail" (timeline feed from audit.jsonl with action badges, run ID chips, hash integrity indicators, load more pagination)
- `App/src/pages/maintenance.tsx` — Premium glass upgrade: GlassPanel hero with amber glow + summary badges, pill-style tabs, MetricCards for overview stats, GlassPanel throughout all 7 tabs (overview/runs/modes/gates/patches/policies/schemas), StatusChip for all status indicators
- API: `GET /api/audit-log` (supports `?limit=`, `?run_id=`, `?action=` filters), enhanced `/api/health` with `engineVersion`, `totalRuns`, `auditEntries`

**Phase 7 — New Run Premium Intake** (Complete):
- `App/src/components/intake-wizard.tsx` — Premium shell: GlassPanel hero header with Rocket icon + "Step X of Y" badge, numbered progress rail with connecting lines (green completed/cyan current/muted future), glass-wrapped form area, cyan Next button with "Enter ↵" hint, green Submit button, violet AI autofill banners, red glow error banners

**Phase 8 — Command Center Second Pass** (Complete):
- `App/src/components/command-palette.tsx` — Full command palette (Cmd+K / Ctrl+K): search input with cmdk, Navigation/Actions/Recent Assemblies categories, dark glass aesthetic, cyan selection highlight, Escape to close
- `App/src/components/layout/AppShell.tsx` — Global keyboard shortcut listener (Cmd+K), `<Toaster />` from sonner with dark theme
- `App/src/components/layout/Topbar.tsx` — Search button wired to open command palette via `onSearchClick` prop
- Toast notifications: success/error toasts on assembly create, pipeline start/kill, assembly delete (intake-wizard.tsx, assembly.tsx, assemblies.tsx)
- `GET /api/stats` endpoint — Server-side aggregated analytics: totalRuns, completedRuns, failedRuns, successRate, avgDurationMs, totalTokensUsed, runsToday/completedToday/failedToday, longestRun, recentFailureRate
- Dashboard metric cards enhanced: "Failed" shows failure rate %, "Completed Today" shows avg duration, "System Health" shows token usage
- Alert cards: "Retry" button (re-runs pipeline) and "Dismiss" button (client-side filter)
- `App/vite.config.ts` — React deduplication via `resolve.dedupe` for sonner compatibility

**Remaining phases**: Phase 9 (further Command Center refinements if needed), Phase 10 (Knowledge consolidation), Phase 11 (Export second pass), Phase 12 (Polish — density toggle, keyboard shortcuts).

### Build Mode (BM-00 through BM-18)
Internal Build Mode takes an approved Agent Kit from a completed pipeline run and generates a full project repository, verifies it, and optionally exports it as a downloadable zip. The build tab supports building from any previously completed pipeline run via a run selector (not just the latest run). Backend endpoints (`POST /api/assemblies/:id/build`, `GET /api/assemblies/:id/build`, `GET /api/assemblies/:id/build/download`) accept optional `runId` parameter and enforce run ownership (run must belong to the assembly) and path safety via `safePath()`. `GET /api/assemblies/:id/runs/buildable` returns all completed runs with kits available for building.

**Flow**: Agent Kit → Eligibility → **Kit Extraction (KEX)** → **Repo Blueprint (RBP)** → Plan → **GSE (Generation Strategy Engine)** → Workspace → Generate (unit-centric) → Manifests → Verify (fidelity) → Export → Finalize

**Core Design Principles**:
- **Minimum Sufficient Artifact Set**: The build system produces the smallest artifact set that fully satisfies all required functional, structural, verification, and operational obligations implied by the Agent Kit and selected build profile. No file without a coverage justification.
- **Structure First, Code Second**: All repo structure (directories, files, modules) is decided by the blueprint before generation. The model only fills predefined targets — it cannot invent new files. `file_inventory` is the single source of structural truth.
- **Unit-Centric Generation**: Generation operates on coherent architectural units (entity clusters, endpoint families, screen bundles) that expand into multiple artifacts from one model call, rather than generating individual files independently.
- **Token-Aware Architecture**: The model only reads the smallest possible slice of the specification (context capsule) necessary for the build unit being generated. Instruction freezing: system prompt loaded once per session, not per call.

**Build Pipeline (KEX → RBP → Plan → GSE → Generate)**:

- **B1: Kit Extraction (KEX)** — `extractor.ts`: Reads all 11 required kit layers. Derives `DerivedBuildInputs` (app identity, domain model with entities/relationships/state machines, subsystems, feature map, interfaces with routes/endpoints/events, data schemas, security model with RBAC, verification expectations). Produces `RepoInventory`. Generates `RequirementTraceEntry[]`. Writes `kit_extraction.json`. Gate: `checkExtractionGate()`.
  - **Derive function paths**: SOURCE_LAYERS: `03_architecture`, `08_data`, `09_api_contracts`, `05_security`, `06_quality`. Entity extraction uses `#{1,2}` headings filtered by SECTION_WORDS exclusion set.

- **B2: Repo Blueprint (RBP)** — `blueprint.ts`: Converts extraction into a fully specified repo design with **build profile derivation** and **sufficiency gating**.
  - **Build Profile Derivation** (`deriveBuildProfile()`): Analyzes kit signals to classify project scope:
    - **lean**: < 4 features, no RBAC, no workflows, simple CRUD → minimal verification, no ops, no contracts
    - **standard**: 4-12 features, basic auth, some workflows → standard verification, basic ops, internal contracts
    - **enterprise**: 12+ features OR (RBAC 3+ roles AND 4+ workflows) OR 15+ acceptance criteria → thorough verification, full ops, explicit contracts, managed persistence
  - **BuildProfileConfig**: `{ profile, verification_depth, ops_tier, contract_tier, persistence_tier }`
  - **Sufficiency Gate** (`shouldCreateArtifact()`): Every artifact family passes a policy test before entering `file_inventory`. Each file gets `required_reason` and `justification` (functional/structural/verification/operational/support_dependency). Four gates per candidate file: functional, structural, verification, operational.
  - **Conditional Artifact Families** (only created when warranted):
    - **Entity cluster** (4-12 files per entity): model + type (always), repository + schema (if persistence), validator + mapper (if enterprise), contract (if contracts != none), fixture + integration_test (if thorough), migration + seed (if managed persistence), service (if business logic)
    - **Endpoint family** (2-8 files per feature): route + controller (always), DTOs (if explicit contracts), auth_policy (if auth), contract_test + mock (if thorough), audit_hook (if full ops)
    - **Screen bundle** (2-10 files per feature): page + component (always), form/list/detail (if heuristic), hook + context (if data), form_schema (if form + contracts), api_binding + skeleton (if contracts != none), e2e_test (if thorough)
    - **Infrastructure**: entry_point/app_entry/config (always), CI (if ops != none), Docker/deploy/telemetry/audit (if full ops), utility libs (if not lean)
    - **Docs**: README (always), ARCHITECTURE/DEPLOYMENT/TESTING (if full ops)
  - Writes `repo_blueprint.json` with `build_profile` field. Gate: `checkBlueprintGate()`.

- **B3: Blueprint-Driven Planning** — `planner.ts` derives ALL file targets from `blueprint.file_inventory`. Files grouped by layer into BuildSlices. Legacy fallback when no blueprint provided.

- **B4: Generation Strategy Engine (GSE)** — `gse.ts`: Classifies all planned files into build units, scores complexity, routes generation, and computes wave plans.
  - **`deriveBuildUnits()`**: Groups file_inventory into coherent units by source_ref/path patterns. Unit types: entity_unit, endpoint_unit, screen_unit, shared_unit, infra_unit, verification_unit. Every file belongs to exactly one unit (no orphans).
  - **`scoreComplexity()`**: 8-dimension weighted scoring → C0/C1/C2/C3/C4:
    - C0 (0-10): barrel exports, simple configs → deterministic
    - C1 (11-25): schemas, DTOs, fixtures, seeds, skeletons → deterministic
    - C2 (26-45): validators, mappers, simple services, standard components → gpt-4o-mini
    - C3 (46-70): route handlers, auth policies, business services, stateful UI → gpt-4o-mini or gpt-4o
    - C4 (71-100): security middleware, complex orchestration → gpt-4o
    - Factors: base_role_weight, dependency_count, security_sensitivity, state_complexity, business_rule_density, integration_depth, acceptance_linkage, cross_cutting_concern
  - **`routeGenerationStrategy()`**: C0/C1→deterministic, C2→cheap_model (gpt-4o-mini), C3→cheap/full based on security flags, C4→full_model (gpt-4o). Computes `CostForecast`.
  - **`computeWavePlan()`**: 5 dependency-ordered waves: foundations → entities → endpoints → screens → verification
  - **`assembleContextCapsule()`**: Builds targeted context slice per unit (~150-400 tokens). Entity unit: fields, relationships, requirements. Endpoint unit: spec, entity schema, auth policy. Screen unit: feature description, deliverables, design specs. Never sends full kit.
  - **Artifacts**: `runs/<RUN_ID>/build/generation_strategy/` — build_unit_inventory.json, complexity_profile.json, generation_strategy_plan.json, wave_plan.json, cost_report.json

- **B5: Unit-Centric Generation** — `generator.ts`: Refactored for unit-centric generation with instruction freezing.
  - **Instruction Freezing**: `buildFrozenSystemPrompt()` builds compact system instructions once per session (~400-600 tokens). No full file manifest re-sent per call.
  - **`generateUnit()`**: For deterministic units: calls `generateDeterministic()` per file. For model units: builds combined prompt with context capsule + file targets → one model call → parses multi-file output (`===FILE: path===` format). Fallback to file-by-file on parse failure.
  - **Model Routing**: `generateCode()` accepts `model` parameter. C2→gpt-4o-mini, C3→gpt-4o-mini (retry with gpt-4o), C4→gpt-4o. Default (no GSE)→gpt-4o (backward compatible).
  - **Structural Integrity Safeguard**: After generation, validates all produced file paths exist in file_inventory. Rejects invented paths. Logs structural violations.
  - **Generator role handlers**: Deterministic: db_schema_entity, request_dto, response_dto, shared_contract, test_fixture, db_seed_entity, form_schema, ci_config, deploy_config, docker_config, test_utility, loading_skeleton, migration_file. AI-assisted: entity_validator, entity_mapper, auth_policy, contract_test, test_mock, api_binding, audit_hook.

- **B6: Generation Fidelity Metrics** — `verifier.ts`: `BuildFidelityReport` tracks planned_files, generated_files, verified_files, failed_files, fidelity_pct (verified/planned × 100), llm_file_count, llm_usage_pct, deterministic_pct, structural_violations. Build summary logged after verification.

**Build Pipeline Metrics** (RUN-000036, 309-file kit with 8 features / 4 roles / 5 workflows / 22 work units / 22 acceptance criteria):
- Legacy fallback: 134 files
- Blueprint pipeline (enterprise profile): 1,180 files (780% improvement) — frontend 127, backend 344, shared 148, data 236, test 306, config 14, docs 5
- Justification breakdown: functional 182, operational 123, structural 92, verification 74, support_dependency 8
- Extraction: 11/11 layers, 58 entities, 82 endpoints, 6 subsystems
- GSE: 37 build units, 5 waves, ~728K estimated tokens, ~$0.30 estimated cost
- Generation: 691 AI-assisted + 489 deterministic across 6 slices

**Build States (BM-08)**: `not_requested → requested → approved → building → verifying → passed → exported`; `failed` reachable from any active state

**Modules** (`Axion/src/core/build/`):
- `types.ts` — Build states, transitions, failure classes, manifest/plan/verification interfaces, KEX/RBP types, plus: `BuildProfile`, `BuildProfileConfig`, `ArtifactJustification`, `BlueprintFileEntry` (with `required_reason`/`justification`), GSE types (`BuildUnit`, `ComplexityProfile`, `GenerationStrategy`, `WavePlan`, `GenerationStrategyPlan`, `CostForecast`, `ContextCapsule`, `UnitGenerationResult`, `BuildFidelityReport`)
- `extractor.ts` — Kit Extraction engine (KEX): `extractKit()`, `checkExtractionGate()`
- `blueprint.ts` — Repo Blueprint builder (RBP): `buildRepoBlueprint()`, `checkBlueprintGate()`, `deriveBuildProfile()`, `shouldCreateArtifact()`. 13 gated add functions for conditional artifact families.
- `gse.ts` — Generation Strategy Engine: `deriveBuildUnits()`, `scoreComplexity()`, `routeGenerationStrategy()`, `computeWavePlan()`, `assembleContextCapsule()`, `runGSE()`
- `eligibility.ts` — BM-09 entry condition checker (kit exists, 8 gates passed, canonical spec, work breakdown, rendered docs, no critical blockers)
- `planner.ts` — Derives build plan from blueprint (preferred) or kit directly (fallback): stack profile, repo shape, ordered build slices. Blueprint-driven mode: `createBlueprintDrivenPlan()` maps `file_inventory` entries to slices by layer. Legacy mode: 8 ordered build slices (scaffold → types_contracts → data_layer → api_routes → components → integration → tests → config) with per-feature sub-components, auth infrastructure, shared services, UI primitives
- `workspace.ts` — Creates/manages `Axion/.axion/runs/RUN-XXXXXX/build/` with repo/, manifests, verification report, zip
- `generator.ts` — Core code generation engine: reads all 12 doc slots into `KitContext` plus work breakdown, page manifest, and enrichment files (BUILD_BRIEF.md, DESIGN_IDENTITY.md, normalized design/intent from normalized_input_record.json). Smart context selection via `findRelevantDocs()`. **Kit-aware code generation**: `extractBrandColors()` reads brand colors from normalized design data or parses DESIGN_IDENTITY.md hex table; `extractDesignPreset()` reads visual preset; `extractNavPattern()` reads navigation preference; `extractProjectOverview()` reads product summary from BUILD_BRIEF or intent goals. `buildDesignDirective()` injects brand colors, visual preset style guidance, and nav pattern into every AI system prompt. `buildUserPrompt()` injects product overview, out-of-scope items, technical profile from BUILD_BRIEF. **Brand-aware deterministic generators**: genTailwindConfig uses `hexToShades()` to generate full 50-900 palette from brand primary/secondary/accent colors (falls back to blue if no design data); genGlobalStyles uses primary-* Tailwind classes for buttons/inputs/focus rings; genLoadingSpinner/genErrorBoundary/genPagination all use primary-* color classes. **Enterprise generators**: deterministic for ErrorBoundary, EmptyState, Pagination, ApiEndpoints (per-feature CRUD routes), AuthContext (JWT auth provider), ProtectedRoute (role-based guard), ForgotPassword page, vite.config.ts (React plugin + @ alias), postcss.config.js (tailwind + autoprefixer), index.html (Vite entry), plus existing main.tsx/NotFound/globals.css/package.json (includes zod, @tanstack/react-query, clsx, axios, lucide-react, date-fns, react-hook-form; devDeps: @vitejs/plugin-react). AI-assisted roles with rich prompt context: feature_form, feature_list, feature_detail, feature_validation, auth_hook, auth_layout, api_interceptor, state_store, validation, route_handler, service_module, middleware_handler, entity_repository, acceptance_test, integration_test, event_handler, feature_card. Blueprint-derived deterministic roles: model_index, route_index, type_barrel (barrel exports), style_entry (Tailwind entry), config_env, migration_file. `buildUserPrompt()` injects `traceRef` requirement descriptions for blueprint-derived files. `COMPLEX_ROLES` expanded to include blueprint AI roles for higher token budgets. System prompt includes project identity + overview, design direction (brand colors, visual preset, nav pattern), available UI components, restricted package list, file manifest for correct imports, BrowserRouter-in-main.tsx instruction, and auth infrastructure for cross-file awareness. User prompt includes per-role design guidance: layout_component gets nav pattern + brand accent colors; auth_layout gets brand primary for buttons/links; feature pages get design specs from kit docs. `extractCodeBlock()` handles fenceless blocks, multiple blocks (picks largest), and strips stray fence markers. Token budget: 8192 for complex roles (feature_page, auth_page, app_entry, layout_component, feature_form/list/detail, settings_page), 6144 for standard roles
- `verifier.ts` — BM-13 verification: output presence, structure correctness, placeholder scan, manifest completeness, file integrity, output consistency
- `manifest.ts` — BM-15 audit records: build_manifest.json, repo_manifest.json, file_index.json with lifecycle transitions
- `packager.ts` — BM-14 export: creates project_repo.zip with repo contents + manifests (uses archiver, max compression)
- `runner.ts` — BM-06 orchestrator: full lifecycle from request through eligibility → workspace init → extract → blueprint → plan → GSE → generate → verify → export with state machine enforcement and failure handling. IMPORTANT: initWorkspace() must run BEFORE extractKit()/buildRepoBlueprint() since it wipes the build/ directory via rmSync

**CLI**: `tsx src/cli/axion.ts build --run RUN-XXXXXX --mode build_and_export` (modes: kit_only, build_repo, build_and_export)

**API Endpoints**:
- `POST /api/assemblies/:id/build` — Trigger build (body: `{ mode: "build_repo" | "build_and_export" }`)
- `GET /api/assemblies/:id/build` — Get build status (state, progress, manifests, verification)
- `GET /api/assemblies/:id/build/download` — Download project_repo.zip (only when exported)

**UI**: Build tab on assembly page with mode selection, progress bars (slices/files), live token tracking with pulsing LIVE badge and per-stage breakdown, verification results, failure display with categorized reasons, download button, retry controls

**Build Token Tracking**: Matches pipeline token tracking pattern — `TOKEN_USAGE:` stdout lines parsed in POST build endpoint with monotonic `api_calls` guard, serialized DB updates via `enqueueBuildUpdate` queue to `assemblies.buildTokenUsage` (jsonb column), live display via `progress.tokenUsage` in GET response, final persistence on process close. UI shows `TokenUsageCard` component with input/output token split, per-stage breakdown, cost, and API call count.

**Path Resolution**: Build runner and eligibility module auto-detect whether they're running from workspace root (`Axion/.axion`) or from within the `Axion/` directory (`.axion`), since the CLI spawns with `cwd: Axion/`.

**Build Workspace** (`Axion/.axion/runs/RUN-XXXXXX/build/`):
- `kit_extraction.json` — KEX proof artifact: source layer results, derived build inputs, repo inventory, requirement trace map, extraction gate result
- `repo_blueprint.json` — RBP design artifact: module map, directory layout, file inventory, interface contracts, data model, security model, traceability map, file count breakdown
- `build_plan.json` — Ordered slices, file targets (derived from blueprint), generation instructions
- `generation_strategy/` — GSE artifacts: build_unit_inventory.json, complexity_profile.json, generation_strategy_plan.json, wave_plan.json, cost_report.json
- `repo/` — Generated project repository
- `build_manifest.json` — Build identity, input provenance, lifecycle transitions, timestamps, status, output refs (includes kitExtractionPath, repoBlueprintPath)
- `repo_manifest.json` — Repo structure summary, file inventory with roles, dependency summary, build commands
- `file_index.json` — All generated files with paths, roles, source references, sizes, generation methods
- `verification_report.json` — Per-category verification results
- `project_repo.zip` — Downloadable archive (when export requested)

### Control Planes
- **ICP (Internal Control Plane)** — `Axion/src/core/controlPlane/`: Run orchestrator (api.ts), model/store (model.ts, store.ts), policies (policies.ts), releases (releases.ts), pins (pins.ts), audit (audit.ts). States: QUEUED → RUNNING → GATED → (FAILED | RELEASED) → ARCHIVED. CLI wired via RunController.
- **KCP (Kit Control Plane)** — `Axion/src/core/kcp/`: 10 modules — model, store, controller, validator, unitManager, verificationRunner, resultWriter, proofCapture, guardrails, runReport. States: READY → EXECUTING → VERIFYING → (BLOCKED | FAILED | COMPLETE). Enforces kit-local rules during build execution.
- **MCP (Maintenance Control Plane)** — `Axion/src/core/mcp/`: 10 modules — model, store, controller, dependencyManager, migrationManager, testMaintainer, refactorManager, ciMaintainer, axionIntegration, modeRunner. States: PLANNED → APPLYING → VERIFYING → (BLOCKED | FAILED | COMPLETE). Handles repo maintenance operations.

### Agent Types
- **IA (Internal Agent)** — `Axion/src/core/agents/internal.ts`: Produces AXION outputs under ICP governance (intake, canonical build, standards, template selection, planning, kit preparation).
- **BA (Build Agent)** — `Axion/src/core/agents/build.ts`: Executes Agent Kit under KCP governance (1-target-per-unit, RESULT artifacts, verification, reruns). Code generation in `generator.ts` uses **Anthropic Claude** (`claude-sonnet-4-6` for full tier, `claude-haiku-4-5` for mini tier) via `@anthropic-ai/sdk` with Replit AI Integrations (`AI_INTEGRATIONS_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `AI_INTEGRATIONS_ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`). Spec/WB enrichment (`openai-bridge.ts`) and doc synthesis (`filler.ts`) remain on GPT-4o.
- **MA (Maintenance Agent)** — `Axion/src/core/agents/maintenance.ts`: Performs repo maintenance under MCP governance (dependency upgrades, migrations, test hardening, CI, rollback).

### Kit Slot & Pack Infrastructure (KIT-01/TMP-06 Compliant)
`Axion/src/core/kit/build.ts` — 12 locked KIT-01 slots: 01_requirements, 02_design, 03_architecture, 04_implementation, 05_security, 06_quality, 07_ops, 08_data, 09_api_contracts, 10_release, 11_governance, 12_analytics. SUBDIR_TO_SLOT maps all template prefix groups to correct slots. Pack root files generated: 00_pack_meta.md (pack_level, pack_id, scope_refs, required_slots, status in machine-readable JSON), 00_pack_index.md (TOC with links), 00_gate_checklist.md (pass/fail). Empty slots get 00_NA.md with reason and trigger condition.

### BA Kit Quality — Rich Data Preservation & Instruction Files
The normalizer, spec builder, and kit builder have been enhanced so the Builder Agent (BA) receives focused, product-specific guidance:

**Normalizer Data Preservation** (`Axion/src/core/intake/normalizer.ts`):
- `NormalizedInputRecord` now includes 5 optional fields: `design`, `intent`, `data_model`, `integrations`, `category_specific` (all `Record<string, unknown>`)
- `normalizeSubmission()` extracts these from the raw submission and includes them only when non-empty
- `design` carries brand_colors, visual_preset, navigation_pref, style_adjectives, ui_density
- `intent` carries primary_goals, success_metrics, out_of_scope, alternatives
- Previously these were silently dropped, leaving the BA with no design or intent context

**Project Name Flow** (`Axion/src/core/canonical/specBuilder.ts`, `Axion/src/core/kit/build.ts`):
- `CanonicalSpecMeta` now has optional `project_name` and `project_overview` fields
- `buildSpec()` populates these from the normalized input's `project` block
- `buildRealKit()` uses 3-level fallback: `meta.project_name` → `project.project_name` → read `normalized_input.json` from intake dir
- Eliminates "Axion Generated Project" as the default — real project name flows through to all kit files

**WorkUnit `name` Field** (`Axion/src/core/planning/workBreakdown.ts`):
- `WorkUnit` interface has optional `name` field alongside `title`
- Feature-based units get `name` from the feature name; non-feature units get `name` from their label
- `enrichWorkBreakdown()` in openai-bridge preserves the `name` field when mapping AI responses

**00_BUILD_BRIEF.md** (`Axion/src/core/kit/build.ts`):
- `buildBuildBriefMd()` generates the BA's primary instruction file — deterministic, no LLM
- Sections: Project Identity, What This App Does, Core Features (table), Design Direction, Technical Profile (auth/compliance/NFRs), User Roles, Key Workflows (top 3), Data Model, Integrations, Build Priority (first 5 work units), What NOT To Build, Success Metrics
- All content extracted from canonical spec, normalized input, and work breakdown JSON

**00_DESIGN_IDENTITY.md** (`Axion/src/core/kit/build.ts`):
- `buildDesignIdentityMd()` generates actionable visual direction — deterministic, no LLM
- Sections: Color System (hex + usage guidance), Visual Preset (preset → implementation mapping for 7 presets), Navigation Pattern (pattern → layout guidance), Typography & Density (compact/comfortable/spacious → specific values), Style Adjectives Applied
- Only generated when design data exists in normalized input

**Enhanced 00_START_HERE.md** (`Axion/src/core/kit/build.ts`):
- `buildStartHereMd()` now accepts projectOverview, featureCount, roleCount, hasDesignIdentity, hasBuildBrief
- Opens with project name and description instead of generic "This kit contains..."
- Reading order puts BUILD_BRIEF first, DESIGN_IDENTITY second
- Includes feature/role count summary and prominent callout to read BUILD_BRIEF first

### Template Selector (TMP-03 Compliant)
`Axion/src/core/templates/selector.ts` — Global type ordering (Product → Design → Architecture → Data → API → Security → Implementation → Quality → Ops → Release → Governance → Analytics) with template_id tie-breaker. Baseline coverage enforcement (always-required: product, architecture, implementation, security, quality; conditional: design, data, api, ops). Selection result includes `omitted_templates[]` with reasons (not_applicable, skill_level_omit, pack_not_active), `na_slots[]`, and `baseline_warnings[]`.

### Template Completeness Gate (TMP-05 Compliant)
`Axion/src/core/templates/completeness.ts` — `runTemplateGate()` performs 5 checks per filled template: TMP5-STRUCT-01 (sections exist), TMP5-FILL-01 (no unresolved {{placeholder}} tokens), TMP5-FILL-02 (no empty required sections), TMP5-REF-01 (entity ID reference validation), TMP5-UNK-01 (UNKNOWN block ID validation). Produces per-template gate report with rule_id, pointer, error_code, message, remediation. Aggregate gate report written to `template_gate_report.json`.

### Version Stamping (KIT-04 Compliant)
`Axion/src/core/kit/build.ts` — 00_VERSIONS.md contains machine-readable JSON block with all 7 KIT-04 categories: V-01 System, V-02 Intake (form/schema/ruleset versions), V-03 Standards (library/packs/resolver), V-04 Templates (library/templates_used[]/index/fill_rules), V-05 Canonical Model (spec/id_rules/unknowns), V-06 Planning/Verification (planning/proof rules), V-07 Kit Contracts (folder_structure/manifest/entrypoint). 00_KIT_MANIFEST.md includes version_cross_check block.

### CAN-03 Unknown Format
`Axion/src/core/templates/filler.ts` — When the IA genuinely can't resolve content, generates CAN-03 compliant unknowns with unk_ prefix IDs, unknown_type, severity, blocking, summary, detail, impact, what_is_needed_to_resolve. Rendered in TMP-02 Section 11 format. `fill_unknowns_audit.json` written when unknowns exist. UNKNOWNs are the fallback — AI synthesis fills content whenever possible.

### Capability Control Center (formerly Feature Registry)
- **Route**: `/features` (nav label: "Capabilities")
- **Page**: `App/src/pages/capabilities.tsx` — top-level orchestration page; `App/src/pages/features.tsx` is a thin re-export alias
- **Detail**: `/features/:id` — Feature detail inspector with tabbed spec viewer (Contract, Errors, Security, Gates & Proofs, Tests, Observability, Docs, API), source modules list, dependency/reverse-dependency links, gate badges
- **API**: `GET /api/features` (17 registries), `GET /api/features/:id` (registry + specs + reverse deps)
- **Types**: `App/src/types/capabilities.ts` — Feature, CapabilityRecord, CapabilityStats, CapabilityFilterState, CapabilityPageModel, ImplementationStatus, RiskLevel, ReadinessLabel, DependencyHealth, GateHealth, ModuleHealth, AttentionFlag, CapabilityWarningCode, CapabilityTabId, CapabilitySortMode
- **Lib (derivation helpers)**: `App/src/lib/capabilities/` — deriveImplementationStatus.ts, deriveReadinessScore.ts, collectAttentionFlags.ts, deriveCapabilityRecord.ts, buildCapabilityPageModel.ts
- **Hooks**: `App/src/hooks/capabilities/useCapabilitiesPage.ts` (orchestration: fetch, tab/filter/sort state, model), `useCapabilitiesPageModel.ts` (wraps buildCapabilityPageModel in useMemo)
- **Components**: `App/src/components/capabilities/` — CapabilitiesPageHeader, CapabilityStatStrip, CapabilityStatCard, CapabilityControlBar, CapabilityTabs, CapabilityCard, CapabilityCardCompact, CapabilityBoard, CapabilityBadge, MetricChip, WarningPill, AttentionPanel, CoverageCalloutRow, CapabilitiesEmptyState
- **Tab Panels**: `App/src/components/capabilities/panels/` — OverviewPanel, ReadinessPanel, DependenciesPanel, GatesPanel, ModulesPanel, RiskPanel
- **Two-layer status model**: Registry status (active/draft/error/deprecated) + Implementation status (implemented/partial/stubbed/spec_only/blocked/unverified) — derived client-side from src_modules, gates, dependencies
- **Readiness scoring**: 0–100 heuristic (ready/near_ready/partial/fragile/blocked) based on registry status, modules, gates, unresolved deps
- **Risk levels**: low/moderate/high/critical — derived from reverse dep count, missing modules/gates, error state, unresolved deps
- **6 tabs**: Overview (attention panel + coverage callouts + card board), Readiness (implementation status lanes), Dependencies (dep health + chains), Gates (coverage + warnings), Modules (linkage + warnings), Risk (blast radius + fragility)
- **Filters**: search (ID/title/description/modules/deps/gates), category, registry status, implementation status, risk level, sort (7 modes), quick toggles (blocked/incomplete/unverified/missing gates/missing modules/high impact)
- Health page shows Feature Packs summary card with total/active counts and category breakdown

### OpenAI Autofill Integration
- `server/openai.ts` — OpenAI client using Replit AI Integrations (AI_INTEGRATIONS_OPENAI_BASE_URL + AI_INTEGRATIONS_OPENAI_API_KEY), model: `gpt-4o`
- `POST /api/autofill` — returns structured suggestions for intake sections based on routing + project info + attached file contents
- **Attachment-aware**: `readAttachmentContents()` reads text-based attached files (.txt, .md, .csv, .json, .xml, .rtf) from `uploads/` and includes their content in the AI prompt; binary files (.pdf, .zip, .doc, .docx, .xlsx, .xls) noted but skipped; per-file limit 4000 chars, total limit 12000 chars; filename validated against upload pattern (16 hex + ext) with path traversal protection
- **Two AI features** (independent): (1) Auto-prefill — opt-in toggle on Page 0 (routing), triggers automatically on page navigation; (2) Suggestions button — manual button at top of form pages 2-9 (Intent through Category), always available regardless of autofill toggle, shows "Re-suggest" if already used
- "AI-drafted" badge on auto-filled/suggested fields; all values editable
- Supported sections: intent, design, functional, data, auth, integrations, nfr, category_specific (each with section-specific prompts + knowledge domain mapping)

### Pipeline OpenAI Integration (IA Agent)
- `Axion/src/core/agents/openai-bridge.ts` — OpenAI bridge for pipeline stages, wraps OpenAI client for use within Axion CLI
- **S3 (Build Canonical)**: After deterministic spec building, calls OpenAI to enrich feature descriptions, add failure states to workflows, and generate project-specific rules
- **S8 (Build Plan)**: After deterministic work breakdown, calls OpenAI to enrich work unit descriptions with implementation details and acceptance criteria
- All OpenAI calls are gracefully optional — if API key is missing or call fails, pipeline falls back to deterministic output
- Intake data race condition fixed: `pipeline-runner.ts` writes `pending_intake.json` BEFORE spawning CLI; `runControlPlane.ts` copies it into run dir before S1 executes
- **Parallel rendering**: S7 template rendering uses configurable concurrency (env `AXION_IA_CONCURRENCY`, default 3, max 10) — batches of N templates rendered concurrently via `Promise.all`, results sorted deterministically by template_id

### Token Usage Tracking
- `Axion/src/core/usage/tracker.ts` — In-memory accumulator for OpenAI token usage per pipeline run
- **Tracked call sites**: `filler.ts` (S7_RENDER_DOCS stage), `openai-bridge.ts` (S3_CANONICAL_SPEC, S5_WORK_BREAKDOWN, S7_TEMPLATE_ENRICH stages), `server/openai.ts` (AUTOFILL stage)
- **Cost model**: gpt-4o at $2.50/1M input, $10/1M output; gpt-4o-mini at $0.15/1M input, $0.60/1M output
- **Live streaming**: `recordUsage()` emits `TOKEN_USAGE: {...}` to stdout after each API call with cumulative totals and per-stage breakdown; `pipeline-runner.ts` parses these lines in real-time and updates `pipeline_runs.tokenUsage` (jsonb) incrementally during the run
- **Persistence**: `cmdRunFull()` writes final `token_usage.json` to run dir; `pipeline-runner.ts` also reads it on completion as reconciliation
- **UI**: Assembly overview shows Token Usage card (total/input/output tokens + estimated cost) with per-stage breakdown and pulsing "LIVE" badge during active runs; auto-refreshes every 2s while running; Pipeline tab run history table includes Tokens and Cost columns

### Intake Library (`Axion/libraries/intake/`)

### Pipeline Runner (server/pipeline-runner.ts)
- Spawns `npx tsx Axion/src/cli/axion.ts run` as child process
- Parses stdout for stage progress and gate results
- Updates `pipeline_runs` and `assemblies` in real-time
- Stores run_id and run artifacts path on completion
- Writes `intakePayload` to `.axion/runs/<run_id>/intake/raw_submission.json` before S1 stage if available
- Kill switch: `killPipeline(assemblyId)` sends SIGTERM then SIGKILL after 5s, marks pending stages as `cancelled`, updates run/assembly status to `failed`. Exposed via `POST /api/assemblies/:id/kill`. Handles stale running state (no live process) by cleaning up DB directly.
- Process tracking: `runningProcesses` Map keyed by assemblyId stores child process handle, pipelineRunId, startTime. Cleaned up on process close. `isRunning(assemblyId)` export for checking.

### Assembly Detail UI (App/src/pages/assembly.tsx)
- Status banners: Running (blue, spinner, progress bar, elapsed timer, current stage "Stage X of N — Name", Stop button), Failed (red, alert icon, error message or failed stage name), Completed (green, checkmark, stage count and duration)
- Elapsed timer: `useElapsedTime` hook ticks every second while pipeline is running
- Kill button: Header + Overview both show "Stop Pipeline" (red) when running, with confirm dialog. Replaces "Run Pipeline" button during execution
- Latest run selection: `runs[0]` (API returns newest-first via `orderBy(desc(startedAt))`)
- Cancelled stage status: Orange dots in PipelineProgress, "Remaining" label replaces "Pending" when cancelled stages exist

### Intake Wizard (App/src/components/intake-wizard.tsx)
- 11-page multi-step wizard per INT-01 form spec (Pages 0-10)

- Shared `IntakeData` type in `App/src/components/intake/types.ts`
- Per-page validation (routing fields required on P0, project name/problem statement on P1, 3 checkboxes on P10)
- Conditional pages: P5 (data) gated by manages_data toggle, P6 (auth) gated by requires_auth, P7 (integrations) gated by has_integrations
- P9 renders category-specific variant (software/data/docs/other) based on P0 routing.category
- On submit: builds INT-02-compliant intakePayload, creates assembly, optionally starts pipeline

## Mechanics Pipeline (Axion/)

### Architecture
The pipeline is fully registry-driven with deterministic library loading:
- **Library Loader** (`src/core/libraries/loader.ts`): Loads pinned libraries from `PINS_DEFAULT.v1.json` → `library_index.v1.json` → `schema_registry.v1.json`. Strict version matching, optional hash enforcement.
- **Zod Schemas** (`src/core/schemas/index.ts`): Runtime validators for all artifact types (intake, canonical, standards, templates, planning, proof, kit).
- **Registry files** (`libraries/`): ~30 versioned JSON contract files across intake, canonical, standards, templates, planning, gates, verification, kit, orchestration, policy, audit, telemetry domains.

- **Governance Layer (Phase 1 upgrade):** 6 governance docs (TMP-1: registry rules, TMP-2: applicability/selection, TMP-3: placeholder provenance/forbidden guessing, TMP-4: completeness/proofs, TMP-5: backcompat/migrations with tiers BC-0 through BC-4, TMP-6: template health metrics). 3 governance schemas: `template_unit.v1`, `template_decision_report.v1`, `placeholder_provenance.v1`. Governed template registry with 8 domain entries. Registered in `schema_registry.v1.json` (3 entries), `library_index.v1.json` (1 entry).
- **Filler Engine**: `filler.ts` reads each template's Output Format (Section 7) and produces a filled document using canonical spec entities (features, roles, workflows, permissions), standards, constraints, and intake data. Supports 5 placeholder types: direct, array, derived, optional, unknown-allowed. TMP-04 precedence: Canonical Spec → Standards → Work Breakdown → Acceptance Map. Garbled heading detection (`isGarbledHeading`) folds broken column-name fragments back under parent headings as tableColumns. Instruction-like sub-headings (no leading digit) fold under preceding numbered heading as description. ALL placeholder sections sent to OpenAI for synthesis (not just knowledge-matched ones); knowledge provides supplementary reference material when available.
- **Selector**: `template_index.json` → registry-driven selection with rationale
- **Rendered Output**: Filled documents written to `.axion/runs/<runId>/templates/rendered_docs/` — contain real project data (entity tables, requirements, cross-references), not template instruction text
- **Completeness**: checks filled content quality; UNKNOWN_ALLOWED fields don't block
- **Read-Only Guard**: `assertNotTemplateLibrary()` prevents any write to `libraries/templates/`; IA guardrail IA-G07 enforces at agent level
- Evidence: writes selection_result.json, render_envelopes.json, template_completeness_report.json, rendered docs

### Proof & Verification
- Proof Ledger: append-only proof_ledger.jsonl linking proofs to run_id, gate_id, acceptance_refs
- Verification Runner: collects gate reports, verifies all passed, writes verification_run_result.json
- Evidence Pointers: dereferences file pointers, verifies files exist, optional hash match
- Completion Report: aggregated verification status

### Kit Packaging (S10) — KIT-01 compliant
Produces full `agent_kit/` folder hierarchy inside `kit/bundle/`:
- `00_START_HERE.md` (KIT-03: purpose, reading order, execution loop, completion definition)
- `00_KIT_MANIFEST.md` (KIT-02: fenced JSON with reading_order, core_artifacts map, proof, versions)
- `00_KIT_INDEX.md` (table of contents)
- `00_VERSIONS.md` (KIT-04: V-01 through V-07 version categories)
- `00_RUN_RULES.md` (no claims without proof, follow work breakdown)
- `00_PROOF_LOG.md` (empty initial proof log)
- `01_core_artifacts/` — 6 required JSONs (normalized_input, standards_snapshot, canonical_spec, work_breakdown, acceptance_map, state_snapshot)
- `10_app/` — 12 domain slot folders (01_requirements through 12_analytics), each with rendered templates or `00_NA.md`

## Knowledge Library (`Axion/libraries/knowledge/`)
Registry-based knowledge authority with 4-layer metadata-driven organization (SYSTEM/CONTENT/VIEWS/BUNDLES), 635 canonical KIDs, faceted classification, and new resolver module. Migrated from folder-based PILLARS/ tree to flat canonical items with rich frontmatter metadata.

**Organizational Model (v2 — registry-based):**
- Canonical items live in `CONTENT/ITEMS/{kid}.md` with enriched frontmatter (kid, title, content_type, primary_domain, industry_refs, stack_family_refs, pillar_refs, status, authority_tier, tags, legacy_path)
- Resolution is metadata-first: direct KID → alias → legacy path → legacy filename → search
- `PILLARS/` tree is frozen (legacy, read-only fallback only)

**Directory Structure:**
- `SYSTEM/doctrine/` — 8 doctrine docs (KNO-0 through KNO-7)
- `SYSTEM/contracts/` — 17+ contract files (KL-1 through KL-7): schemas, rules, validation checklists, gate specs
- `SYSTEM/registries/` — knowledge.index.json (635 items), aliases.index.json, relationships.index.json, bundles.index.json, knowledge_registry.v1.json, sources.index.json, deprecations.json, changelog.md
- `SYSTEM/taxonomy/` — taxonomy.json, tags.json, quality_tiers.json, vocab.*.json (8 vocabulary files for controlled enums)
- `SYSTEM/policies/` — 5 policy files
- `SYSTEM/templates/` — 8 templates
- `CONTENT/ITEMS/` — 635 canonical KID files with enriched frontmatter
- `CONTENT/META/collections/` — 236 collection descriptors (domain/industry/stack)
- `VIEWS/` — Generated browsing views: by_pillar/, by_domain/ (111), by_content_type/ (5), by_industry/ (9), by_stack_family/ (77), by_status/, by_authority/
- `BUNDLES/` — 10 bundle files (by run_profile, risk_class, executor)
- `REUSE/` — Allowlist and reuse log
- `OUTPUTS/` — Migration reports, selection and export schemas
- `PILLARS/` — FROZEN legacy tree (639 KID files, kept for fallback only)

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/knowledge-library` — overview (groups, schemas, registries, counts from SYSTEM/)
- `GET /api/knowledge-library/docs` — doctrine docs from SYSTEM/doctrine/
- `GET /api/knowledge-library/docs/:filename` — individual doctrine doc
- `GET /api/knowledge-library/schemas` — contract schemas from SYSTEM/contracts/
- `GET /api/knowledge-library/registries` — all registries from SYSTEM/registries/
- `GET /api/knowledge-library/registries/:name` — individual registry
- `GET /api/knowledge-library/search?text=&content_type=&primary_domain=&status=&authority_tier=&limit=` — faceted metadata search
- **UI:** `/knowledge-library` — Knowledge Library page with Documents/Schemas/Registries tabs

**New Resolver Module** (`Axion/src/knowledge/resolver/`):
- `types.ts` — KnowledgeFrontmatter, KnowledgeItem, AliasIndex (flat map), RelationshipIndex, KnowledgeIndexEntry, CollectionDescriptor, ResolveSource, ResolveResult, SearchFilters, SearchResult
- `paths.ts` — centralized filesystem paths
- `registry.ts` — cached loaders for knowledge.index.json, aliases.index.json, relationships.index.json with clearResolverCaches()
- `resolveKid.ts` — multi-step resolution: direct KID → alias → legacy path → legacy filename → null
- `loadItem.ts` — load canonical item from CONTENT/ITEMS using gray-matter
- `loadRelationships.ts` — load from relationships.index.json
- `loadCollections.ts` — match collections by item metadata scopes
- `searchItems.ts` — faceted search on metadata fields with scoring
- `legacyFallback.ts` — infer search filters from old PILLARS/ paths
- `index.ts` — public API: resolveKnowledge(), re-exports

**Migration Scripts** (`Axion/scripts/knowledge/`):
- `migrate-kids-to-canonical.ts` — migrates KIDs from PILLARS/ to CONTENT/ITEMS/ with enriched frontmatter, builds aliases.index.json and relationships.index.json (--dry-run / --apply)
- `migrate-meta-to-collections.ts` — converts _meta.md files to collection descriptors in CONTENT/META/collections/ (--dry-run / --apply)
- `build-knowledge-index.ts` — rebuilds knowledge.index.json from CONTENT/ITEMS/ frontmatter
- `generate-views.ts` — generates VIEWS/by_*/ browsing index files from knowledge.index.json

**Legacy Core Resolver** (`Axion/src/core/knowledge/resolver.ts`):
- Updated to read from SYSTEM/registries/ and SYSTEM/taxonomy/ (new paths)
- Handles both old format ({ items: [...] }) and new format (flat array) for knowledge.index.json
- Maps new field names (content_type→type, authority_tier→maturity, pillar_refs→pillar, primary_domain→domains) for backward compatibility
- `resolveKnowledge(baseDir, routing, constraints)` → loads index, matches bundle, filters KIDs by domain, returns `KnowledgeContext`
- `summarizeKnowledgeForPrompt(knowledge, maxKids)` → formats KIDs for OpenAI system prompt injection
- `getKnowledgeCitationsForDomain(knowledge, domainKeywords)` → per-heading KID lookup

### Knowledge Library Integration (IA wiring)
The Knowledge Library is wired into the IA through three integration points:

1. **Autofill (OpenAI)** — `server/openai.ts` calls `resolveKnowledge()` before each OpenAI request, injects relevant KID summaries into the system prompt so suggestions are scoped by domain-relevant patterns, checklists, and pitfalls. Section-specific domain filtering via `SECTION_KNOWLEDGE_DOMAINS` map.

2. **Template Selection (S6)** — `Axion/src/core/templates/selector.ts` accepts optional `KnowledgeContext`, annotates templates with `knowledge_boost` rationale token when template domains overlap with resolved KID domains. Does NOT override `applies_when` constraints — knowledge boost is informational only, maintaining registry-driven selection integrity.

3. **Template Filling (S7)** — `Axion/src/core/templates/filler.ts` accepts `knowledge?: KnowledgeContext` in `FillContext`. `buildHeadingContent()` wraps inner content with `renderKnowledgeReferences()`, appending matching KID citations (up to 5 per heading) with maturity badges and content snippets.

### Enforcement Gates (KL-5)
- KL-GATE-01: Referenced KIDs exist in KNOWLEDGE_INDEX
- KL-GATE-02: KID metadata valid per KL-1.3
- KL-GATE-03: Deprecated KIDs not used unless repro mode
- KL-GATE-04: External executor cannot access internal_only KIDs
- KL-GATE-05: Kit export excludes restricted content
- KL-GATE-06: Allowlisted reuse requires reuse_log
- KL-GATE-07: Block verbatim copying beyond excerpt limits
- KL-GATE-08: Production runs require maturity >= reviewed

**IA Registration** (`Axion/src/core/agents/internal.ts`):
- Capability: `knowledge_resolution`
- Constraint: `must_emit_knowledge_citations`
- Guardrail: `IA-G08` — knowledge citations must be emitted when KID content is used
- Evidence: `buildEvidenceRecord()` now accepts optional `knowledgeCitations[]`

**Reports** include knowledge fields:
- `selection_report.json`: `knowledge_citations[]`, `knowledge_boosted_templates[]`
- `render_report.json`: `knowledge_citations[]`, `knowledge_bundle`, `knowledge_domains_used[]`

## System Library (`Axion/libraries/system/`)
Control-plane configuration and runtime contracts for Axion. Defines the stable "operating environment" that every run depends on. **Phase 3 governance upgrade** adds 5 governance-layer SYS docs + 2 governance schemas + 1 governed system registry with resolution order and dependency graph.

### Structure (SYS-0 through SYS-7)
- **SYS-0**: Purpose + boundaries — what system/ governs (in scope) and what it does not (out of scope), boundary checklist
- **SYS-1**: Workspace / Project model — workspace, project, and profile entities; workspace.v1 and project.v1 schemas; run_profiles registry; determinism rules + **SYS-1_system_unit_model.md** (governance: every system component as governed unit with component_id, resolution order, pin/lock behavior, capability filtering)
- **SYS-2**: Pin / Lock policies — deterministic resolution via pins (explicit version refs) and locks (enforcement rules); pin_policy.v1 and pin_set.v1 schemas; resolution rules (workspace → project → run-level) + **SYS-2_system_decision_report.md** (governance: library resolution order, pin decisions, capability filtering results, verdict)
- **SYS-3**: Adapter manager — capability discovery for execution environments (local/Replit/CI/container); capability_registry.v1, adapter_profile.v1, command_policy.v1 schemas; capabilities registry + **SYS-3_cross_library_dependency_graph.md** (governance: formalized resolution order, dependency edges, circular dependency detection)
- **SYS-4**: Quotas + rate limits — per project/profile constraints (runs/day, tokens, compute, storage, network); quota_set.v1 and quota_profile_modifiers.v1 schemas; starter quota sets + **SYS-4_backcompat_and_resolution.md** (governance: backward compatibility for system changes, resolver authority contract, deterministic loader behavior)
- **SYS-5**: Notification routing — deterministic event→destination routing with throttle/dedupe; notification_event_types.v1, notification_destinations.v1, notification_routes.v1 schemas and registries + **SYS-5_system_health.md** (governance: resolution success rate, dependency staleness, capability coverage, pin compliance)
- **SYS-6**: Policy engine hooks — how runtime invokes policy at 6 hook points (RUN_START, PIN_RESOLUTION, ADAPTER_SELECTION, QUOTA_CHECK, GATE_OVERRIDE, KIT_EXPORT); policy_hook_request.v1 and policy_hook_decision.v1 schemas
- **SYS-7**: Minimum viable set — required files inventory, definition of done checklist, minimal folder tree

### Subdirectories
- `schemas/` — 16 JSON Schema files (workspace, project, pin_policy, pin_set, capability_registry, adapter_profile, command_policy, quota_set, quota_profile_modifiers, notification_event_types, notification_destinations, notification_routes, policy_hook_request, policy_hook_decision + governance: system_unit, system_decision_report)
- `registries/` — 7 registry files (run_profiles, capabilities, quota_sets, notification_event_types, notification_destinations, notification_routes + governance: system_registry with governed system components, resolution order, dependency graph)

### Runtime Integration
- **Loader module**: `Axion/src/core/system/loader.ts` — loads and caches all 6 registries, exports typed accessors:
  - `loadSystemLibrary(repoRoot)` — returns `{ profiles, capabilities, quotaSets, eventTypes, destinations, routes }`
  - `getRunProfile(repoRoot, profileId)` — resolve a run profile from the registry
  - `checkQuota(repoRoot, quotaSetId, metric, currentValue)` — check if a metric exceeds its quota limit
  - `resolveNotificationRoutes(repoRoot, eventType)` — find matching notification routes for an event
  - `evaluatePolicyHook(hookPoint, context)` — invoke policy at 6 hook points (currently returns ALLOW by default)
  - `loadSystemDocs/loadSystemSchemas/loadSystemRegistries` — read files for API/UI consumption
- **ICP wiring**: `RunController.createRun()` resolves `system_profile` from run_profiles registry, invokes `evaluatePolicyHook("RUN_START")`, sets `quota_set` on the run. `completeRun()` invokes `evaluatePolicyHook("KIT_EXPORT")` before releasing.
- **ICPRun model**: Added optional `system_profile?: string` and `quota_set?: string` fields
- **API**: 6 new `/api/system/*` endpoints expose system library data to the UI
- **UI**: `/system` page with 3 tabs (Documents, Schemas, Registries), overview cards, expandable content viewers
- **Registered in:** `schema_registry.v1.json` (14 structural + 2 governance entries = 16 total), `library_index.v1.json` (6 structural + 1 governance entries = 7 total)

### Key ID patterns

- Policy decision: `POLDEC-[A-Z0-9]{6,}`

## Orchestration Library (`Axion/libraries/orchestration/`)
Pipeline execution contracts and run lifecycle definitions. Defines the authoritative model for pipeline stages, IO contracts, run manifests, stage reports, and rerun/resume rules. **Phase 3 governance upgrade** adds 5 governance-layer ORC docs + 2 governance schemas + 1 governed orchestration registry with dependency maps and artifact production.

### Structure (ORC-0 through ORC-7)
- **ORC-0**: Purpose + boundaries — what orchestration/ governs (pipeline execution contract) and boundary checklist
- **ORC-1**: Pipeline definition model — stages, ordering, activation rules, gating points; `pipeline_definition.v1.schema.json`; starter pipeline `PIPE-AXION` with 11 stages (S0-S10); determinism rules; validation checklist + **ORC-1_stage_unit_model.md** (governance: every stage as governed unit with stage_id, library consumption, artifact production, gate evidence origins, dependency declarations)
- **ORC-2**: Stage IO contracts — consumes/produces model; `stage_io_contract.v1.schema.json` and `stage_io_registry.v1.schema.json`; 15 IO contracts in starter registry; determinism rules + **ORC-2_orchestration_decision_report.md** (governance: execution plan, stage results, dependency resolution, verdict)
- **ORC-3**: Run manifest format — single authoritative run record; `run_manifest.v1.schema.json`; append-only event semantics; invariants + **ORC-3_execution_dependency_map.md** (governance: stage-to-library dependency declarations, artifact production graph, rerun invalidation rules)
- **ORC-4**: Stage report schema — standard report per stage; `stage_report.v1.schema.json`; example template; determinism rules + **ORC-4_backcompat_and_rerun.md** (governance: backward compatibility for pipeline changes, rerun/resume invalidation rules, migration paths)
- **ORC-5**: Rerun/resume rules — deterministic resume, stage rerun, partial run; `rerun_request.v1.schema.json`; rerun policies registry with downstream invalidation lists; invariants; manifest event requirements + **ORC-5_orchestration_health.md** (governance: stage coverage, dependency freshness, rerun success rate, orphaned stages)
- **ORC-6**: Orchestration gates (ORC-GATE-01 through 06) — stage order integrity, consumes/produces validation, report emission, manifest coherence, rerun invariants; gate spec JSON; evidence format
- **ORC-7**: Minimum viable set — required files inventory, definition of done checklist, minimal folder tree

### Subdirectories
- `schemas/` — 8 JSON Schema files (pipeline_definition, stage_io_contract, stage_io_registry, run_manifest, stage_report, rerun_request + governance: orchestration_unit, orchestration_decision_report)
- `registries/` — 4 registry files (pipeline_definition.axion.v1, stage_io_registry.axion.v1, rerun_policies.axion.v1 + governance: orchestration_registry with governed stage units, dependency maps, artifact production)
- `templates/` — 1 example (stage_report.example.json)

### Runtime Integration
- **Loader module**: `Axion/src/core/orchestration/loader.ts` — loads and caches all 3 registries, exports typed accessors:
  - `loadOrchestrationLibrary(repoRoot)` — returns `{ pipelineDefinition, stageIOContracts, rerunPolicies }`
  - `getPipelineDefinition(repoRoot)` — returns the pipeline definition registry
  - `getStageIOContract(repoRoot, contractId)` — look up a single IO contract by ID
  - `getRerunPolicy(repoRoot, stageId)` — look up rerun policy for a stage
  - `validateStageConsumes(repoRoot, stageId)` — check if all consumes contracts exist
  - `getInvalidatedContracts(repoRoot, stageId)` — get downstream contracts invalidated by rerunning a stage
  - `getStageOrder(repoRoot)` — returns pipeline stage_order from registry (source of truth)
  - `getStageGates(repoRoot)` — builds stage→gate mapping from registry gate_points
  - `getGatesRequired(repoRoot)` — returns all required gate IDs from registry
  - `getStageName(repoRoot, stageId)` / `getStageNames(repoRoot)` — stage display names from registry
  - `loadOrchestrationDocs/loadOrchestrationSchemas/loadOrchestrationRegistries` — read files for API/UI consumption
- **ICP wiring**: `RunController.createRun()` loads stage order, gates, and gates_required from orchestration library (with hardcoded fallback). Sets `pipeline` fields (pipeline_id, version) from the registry. Attaches `pipeline_ref` to every run.
- **CLI wiring**: `cmdRunFull()` and `executeStageWithGates()` load stage order and gates from orchestration library (with fallback)
- **Server wiring**: `pipeline-runner.ts` builds initial stages from orchestration library. `/api/config` returns `stageOrder`, `stageGates`, `gatesRequired`, `stageNames` from loader with `source: "orchestration_library"`.
- **Frontend wiring**: Assembly page fetches `/api/config` via React Query hook `usePipelineConfig()` — no hardcoded stage constants in frontend
- **ICPRun model**: `pipeline_ref?: { pipeline_id, version, source }` field; preserved in manifest round-trip via `config.__pipeline_ref`
- **API**: 6 `/api/orchestration/*` endpoints expose orchestration library data to the UI
- **UI**: `/orchestration` page with 4 tabs (Pipeline, Documents, Schemas, Registries), overview cards, pipeline stage visualization with IO contract labels and gate points
- **Registered in:** `schema_registry.v1.json` (6 structural + 2 governance entries = 8 total), `library_index.v1.json` (3 structural + 1 governance entries = 4 total)

### Output Quality Enforcement
The pipeline enforces output quality through several mechanisms:

**HEADING_DOMAIN_MAP** (`Axion/src/core/templates/filler.ts`): Maps 200+ heading keywords to taxonomy domain names across all three knowledge pillars (IT Domains, Industry Playbooks, Cross-Cutting). This bridge connects template section headings to the knowledge library so the LLM receives relevant reference material when filling sections. Keywords cover: databases, APIs, auth, security, CI/CD, observability, ML/AI, all industry verticals (healthcare, finance, legal, education, etc.), and infrastructure topics.

**Kit Bloat Prevention** (`Axion/src/core/kit/build.ts`): Empty slots (APP_SLOTS with zero rendered documents) no longer produce directories or placeholder `00_NA.md` files. Only slots with actual content get created. The pack index skips empty slots entirely.

**Template Completeness Gate** (`Axion/src/core/templates/completenessGate.ts`): Deep per-section analysis that scans for 18 placeholder patterns (`_Content to be filled_`, `_To be determined_`, `{{...}}`, `TBD`, etc.), checks section length, and computes per-template completeness percentage. Results written to `deep_completeness_report.json`. Gate G5 enforces the shallower `template_completeness_report.json` with `pass: true` check.

**AI Prompt Quality** (`Axion/src/core/templates/filler.ts`, `Axion/src/core/agents/openai-bridge.ts`): LLM prompts explicitly ban vague language ("to be determined", "as needed", "TBD", etc.), require minimum 3 actionable items per section, mandate concrete project-specific details (endpoints, fields, configs), require explicit `**UNKNOWN:**` flags instead of vague placeholders, and set 100-300 word section targets. Spec enrichment prompt requires specific data fields, testable acceptance criteria, and concrete failure states. Work breakdown enrichment requires implementation-level detail with specific test scenarios.

**Kit Validation** (`Axion/src/core/kit/validate.ts`): Validates kit structure on disk — checks for `00_START_HERE.md`, all 6 required core artifacts in `01_core_artifacts/`, JSON artifact parsing, manifest-to-disk cross-reference, and acceptance map → work breakdown cross-reference. Wired into S10; results in `kit_validation_report.json`. Gate G8 enforces `valid: true`.

**Kit Packager** (`Axion/src/core/kit/packager.ts`): Copies kit bundle to output path, generates `manifest.json` with SHA-256 hashes per file, content hash, file counts, and metadata. Ensures `00_START_HERE.md` fallback exists.

### Architecture: Registry-Driven Pipeline
The orchestration library's `pipeline_definition.axion.v1.json` is the **single source of truth** for pipeline execution. All runtime consumers load from the registry via the orchestration loader, with hardcoded fallbacks in `types/run.ts` (marked `@deprecated`) for resilience if the registry file is missing.

Data flow: `registry JSON → loader.ts → RunController / CLI / pipeline-runner / /api/config → frontend`

### Remaining Migration Notes
- The ORC-3 run_manifest.v1 schema defines the *target* manifest format (pipeline_ref, pins, runtime, stage_timeline, artifacts). The current runtime uses the legacy `RunManifest` type from `types/run.ts` with different field names. Full alignment requires a pipeline migration task.
- `pipeline_ref` is stored on `ICPRun` as a first-class field and round-tripped through manifests via `config.__pipeline_ref` for backward compatibility with the legacy `RunManifest` type.

### Maintenance & Updating System (MUS)
Full MUS implementation: CLI + backend API + frontend UI. Replaces the old unit-based maintenance lifecycle with a proposal-first, consent-gated model.

**Core Engine** (`Axion/src/core/mus/`):
- `types.ts` — TypeScript interfaces: MusRun, MusFinding, MusProposalPack, MusPatch, MusBlastRadius, MusChangeSet, MusApprovalEvent, MusSuppressionRule, MusProofBundle, MusScheduleEntry, RegistryEnvelope, LedgerEntry; **MUS v2 types**: AgentDefinition, TaskDefinition, TaskRun, Insight, BottleneckReport, Recommendation
- `engine.ts` — v1: `validateRegistries(root)`, `executeRun()` (DP-REG-01, DP-DRIFT-01); **v2**: `listAgents(root)`, `listTasks(root)`, `createTaskRun()`, `startTaskRun()` (async) with task executors for TASK-OPS-01 (ops monitor), TASK-PERF-01 (pipeline bottleneck finder — reads real pipeline stage timing from `.axion/runs/` + MCP AxionIntegrationMaintainer perf correlation), TASK-QUAL-01 (depth analysis), TASK-QUAL-02 (template audit + MCP TestMaintainer determinism), TASK-COST-01 (cost analysis + MCP DependencyManager tracking), TASK-SYS-01 (integrity/drift + MCP AxionIntegrationMaintainer contract breaks); unknown task IDs fall through to MCP fallback executor
- `mcp-bridge.ts` — Bridge layer: `mapTaskRunToMcpRun()`, `mapCompatibilityReportToFindings/Insight()`, `mapTestReportToInsight()`, `mapDependencyReportToInsight/Findings()`, factory functions for MCP managers
- `store.ts` — File-based `MusStore` class for runs/findings/proposals/changesets/approvals/suppressions under `mus_data/`; **v2**: task-run persistence under `mus_data/task-runs/TRUN-*/`, `saveInsights()`, `saveBottlenecks()`, `saveRecommendations()`, `getInsights()`, `getBottlenecks()`, `getRecommendations()`
- `ledger.ts` — Append-only JSONL audit ledger at `mus_data/logs/ledger.jsonl`

**Safety Constraints** (hard-enforced):
- Scheduled runs are always proposal-only; publish is always blocked for scheduled triggers
- Automation actors cannot create apply or publish approvals
- Apply requires explicit Apply Approval event on the changeset
- Publish requires explicit Publish Approval event (+ scheduled hard block)
- Apply/Publish execution gated and disabled in v1 (501 after gate validation)

**CLI Commands** (`Axion/src/cli/commands/mus.ts`, wired via `axion.ts`):
- `axion mus validate --root <path>` — validate registries/policies, exit 0/1
- `axion mus run --mode MM-01 --trigger manual --scope all --root <path>` — health check (DP-REG-01, findings only)
- `axion mus run --mode MM-04 --trigger manual --scope all --root <path>` — drift detection (DP-DRIFT-01, findings + proposals)
- `axion mus task-run --task TASK-PERF-01 [--agent AGT-PERF-01] [--scope all] [--token-cap N] [--time-cap N] [--max-findings N]` — execute task-based run
- `axion mus tasks` — list available tasks from REG-TASKS.json
- `axion mus agents` — list available agents from REG-AGENTS.json
- `axion mus apply` / `axion mus publish` — stubbed with gate validation, not implemented in v1
- Default root: `./axion_mus_creation/` or `./Axion/libraries/maintenance/`
- Usage docs: `Axion/MUS_USAGE.md`

**Registries** (`Axion/libraries/maintenance/registries/`):
- `REG-AGENTS.json` — 4 agents: AGT-PERF-01 (Performance Analyzer), AGT-QUAL-01 (Quality Auditor), AGT-OPS-01 (Ops Monitor), AGT-COST-01 (Cost Analyzer)
- `REG-TASKS.json` — 6 tasks with runbook steps: TASK-PERF-01 (Pipeline Bottleneck Finder, 9 steps), TASK-QUAL-01 (Detail Depth, 6 steps), TASK-QUAL-02 (Template Audit, 6 steps), TASK-OPS-01 (Internal Monitor, 5 steps), TASK-COST-01 (Token/Compute Waste, 7 steps), TASK-SYS-01 (Integrity/Drift, 6 steps)

**API Endpoints** (`server/mus-routes.ts`, registered via `registerMusRoutes()` in `routes.ts`):
- v1 mode-based: `GET /api/mus/status`, `POST /api/mus/validate`, `POST /api/mus/runs` (mode_id), `POST /api/mus/runs/:runId/start`, `GET /api/mus/runs`, findings/proposals/changesets/approvals/schedules CRUD
- **v2 task-based**: `GET /api/mus/agents`, `GET /api/mus/tasks` (includes runbook), `POST /api/mus/task-runs`, `POST /api/mus/task-runs/:runId/start`, `GET /api/mus/task-runs`, `GET /api/mus/task-runs/:runId`, `GET /api/mus/task-runs/:runId/outputs`, `GET /api/mus/insights`, `GET /api/mus/bottlenecks`, `GET /api/mus/recommendations`, `POST /api/mus/recommendations/:id/convert` (enforces convertible_to_changeset), `GET /api/mus/task-schedules`, `PATCH /api/mus/task-schedules/:taskId`
- Old `/api/maintenance/` read-only endpoints kept for backward compatibility

**Frontend** (`App/src/pages/maintenance.tsx`) — "Ops Console":
- 9 tabs: Overview, Tasks, Task Runs, Findings, Insights, Proposals, Approvals, Schedules, Registries
- **Overview**: v1 metrics (Total Runs, Open Findings, Registries, Policy Loaded) + v2 metrics (Task Runs, Insights), Top Bottleneck highlight panel, Latest Insights summary (top 3)
- **Tasks**: Task catalog (6 tasks with intent badges, agent assignment, output types, collapsible runbook steps), Run Configuration panel (agent override, budget controls), Run Now button with inline results
- **Task Runs**: Expandable run cards with output counts (F/I/B/R), inline detail view with insights, bottlenecks, recommendations (with Convert to ChangeSet button), findings
- **Insights**: Categorized panels (bottleneck, quality, reliability, cost, general) with confidence scores and suggested actions; bottleneck reports with hotspot bars; Recommendations section with Convert to ChangeSet
- **Proposals**: Recommendations section (convertible recs with convert buttons) alongside proposal packs
- **Schedules**: Mode schedules (from REG-SCHEDULES) + Task schedules (schedulable tasks with enable/disable toggles, RRULE display, proposal-only constraint)
- Findings/Approvals/Registries: unchanged from v1

**Data Storage Layout** (`Axion/mus_data/` or `Axion/libraries/mus_data/`):
- v1: `runs/RUN-YYYYMMDD-XXXX/` — run.json, findings.json, proposal_packs.json, blast_radius.json, proof_bundle.json
- **v2**: `task-runs/TRUN-*/` — task_run.json, insights.json, bottlenecks.json, recommendations.json, findings.json
- `insights/INS-*.json`, `bottlenecks/BNR-*.json`, `recommendations/REC-*.json` — individual output files
- `findings/FND-*.json`, `proposals/PP-*.json`, `changesets/CS-*.json`, `approvals/APR-*.json`, `suppressions/SUP-*.json`
- `task_schedule_overrides.json` — task schedule enabled/disabled + rrule overrides
- `logs/ledger.jsonl` — append-only audit ledger

### AVCS — Axion Verification & Certification Suite
Post-build quality gate system. Lifecycle position: Build Mode produces → AVCS verifies/certifies → operator decides → remediation if needed. Not a deployment system — purely verification and certification.

**Core Modules** (`Axion/src/core/avcs/`):
- `types.ts` — TypeScript interfaces: CertificationRun, CertificationFinding, DomainResult, DomainCheck (with test_id field), CoverageEntry, CertificationReport (with test_plan, adapter_status), RemediationManifest, CertificationEvidence, ScoreBreakdown. New types: AVCSTestDefinition, AVCSToolDefinition, AVCSTestPlan, AVCSTestResult, AVCSToolAdapter, ToolAdapterContext, ToolAvailability, TestPhase. Constants: DOMAIN_WEIGHTS, RUN_TYPE_DOMAINS.
- `store.ts` — File-based AVCSStore class for runs/findings/evidence/reports under `avcs_data/`. IDs: CR-XXXXXX (runs), CF-XXXXXX (findings), CE-XXXXXX (evidence).
- `test-catalog.ts` — Formal test catalog: 37 tests across 9 domains (BI, FUNC, SEC, PERF, DEP, UI, UX, ACC, ENT) with stable IDs (DOMAIN-NN format). 17 MVP tests. Exports: TEST_CATALOG, getTestById(), getTestsByDomain(), getMVPTests(), getTestsByRunType(), getTestsByTool().
- `tool-registry.ts` — Approved tool registry: 11 tools (internal, lighthouse, k6, trivy, zap, semgrep, playwright, backstop, axe, pa11y, dependency-check). Exports: TOOL_REGISTRY, resolveTool(), validateToolForRunType(), getToolsByDomain().
- `tool-adapters.ts` — Tool adapter layer with real adapter imports. InternalAdapter (always available, skips non-internal tests), typed adapter factory (createAdapter switch). Exports: getAdapter, getAdapterForTest (with fallback), getAdapterStatus, registerAdapter, clearAdapterCache.
- `adapters/` — Real tool adapter implementations:
  - `base-adapter.ts` — Abstract BaseAdapter class with availability gating and error handling
  - `adapter-utils.ts` — Shared utilities: spawnTool (child_process with timeout/output limits), checkBinaryAvailable, checkNpmToolAvailable, parseJsonSafe, makeSkipResult, makeErrorResult, mapSeverity
  - `semgrep-adapter.ts` — **LIVE**: Runs `semgrep scan --config auto --json`, parses results into findings with severity mapping. Available in Replit (binary present).
  - `lighthouse-adapter.ts` — Full implementation: runs Lighthouse CLI, parses JSON (perf/a11y/best-practices scores, FCP/LCP/SI metrics). Graceful degrade if Chrome not available.
  - `axe-adapter.ts` — Full implementation: runs @axe-core/cli, parses violations with WCAG tag extraction. Needs browser.
  - `playwright-adapter.ts` — Availability detection (npm + browser check). Returns not_available until test scripts configured.
  - `trivy-adapter.ts` — Full implementation: runs `trivy fs --format json`, parses vulnerabilities by severity. Needs trivy binary.
  - `zap-adapter.ts`, `k6-adapter.ts`, `backstop-adapter.ts`, `pally-adapter.ts`, `depcheck-adapter.ts` — Typed adapters with real availability detection (binary/npm/docker checks), structured not_available results with install hints.
- `test-plan-builder.ts` — Test plan builder: buildTestPlan(runType, options) → AVCSTestPlan. Options: mvpOnly (default true), includeDomains, excludeTests. Plans include ordered test list, estimated duration, tool requirements, domain coverage percentages.
- `evaluators.ts` — 5 domain evaluators with formal test IDs: evaluateBuildIntegrity (BI-01 through BI-04), evaluateFunctional (FUNC-01 through FUNC-04), evaluateSecurity (SEC-01, SEC-02, SEC-05), evaluatePerformance (PERF-01 through PERF-03), evaluateDeploymentReadiness (DEP-01 through DEP-03).
- `engine.ts` — Run orchestrator: planRun, executeRun, computeVerdict, computeRemediationManifest, getAVCSStatus.

**Formal Test ID Scheme**: DOMAIN-NN (e.g., BI-01, FUNC-02, SEC-05, DEP-03). Each DomainCheck has a test_id field linking to the catalog.

**9 Test Domains** (5 MVP, 4 Later):
- BUILD_INTEGRITY (BI-01 through BI-05): Artifact location, required files, env contract, startup script, build output
- FUNCTIONAL (FUNC-01 through FUNC-05): Primary workflow, API contract, CRUD ops, error handling, state transitions
- SECURITY (SEC-01 through SEC-05): Dependency vulns, secrets exposure, auth boundary, permissions, unsafe config
- PERFORMANCE (PERF-01 through PERF-05): Startup time, route load, repeated action stability, resource budget, concurrency
- DEPLOYMENT (DEP-01 through DEP-04): Env vars declared, startup path, health endpoint, deployment config
- UI (UI-01 through UI-03): Layout render, responsive layout, visual regression (Later)
- UX (UX-01 through UX-03): Workflow completion, error recovery, empty state actionability (Later)
- ACCESSIBILITY (ACC-01 through ACC-04): Keyboard nav, focus visibility, accessible labels, color contrast (Later)
- ENTERPRISE (ENT-01 through ENT-03): Audit trail, structured logging, observability signals (Later)

**Tool Adapter Architecture**: Test → Tool Resolver → Policy Validation → Tool Adapter → Result. Real adapters in `adapters/` directory extend BaseAdapter with isAvailable() + runTool(). Execution model: npm tools (lighthouse, playwright, backstop, axe, pa11y), binary tools (semgrep, trivy, k6, dependency-check), Docker tools (zap). Currently available in Replit: internal + semgrep. All others gracefully degrade with structured not_available results + install hints. Safe execution: spawnTool() enforces timeouts (default 5min), output size limits (5MB), JSON parsing with error recovery.

**Run Types → Domains**:
- smoke: build_integrity + functional + deployment_readiness
- functional: build_integrity + functional
- security: build_integrity + security
- performance: build_integrity + performance
- full_certification / pre_deployment: all 5 domains

**Certification Verdict Logic**:
- Domain weights: functional=25%, security=20%, build_integrity=20%, performance=15%, deployment_readiness=20%
- Hard-stop rules: no entry point → BLOCKED, critical security finding → FAIL, >50% planned files missing → FAIL
- PASS: score ≥ 80, no critical/high findings
- PASS_WITH_WARNINGS: score ≥ 70, ≤2 high findings
- CONDITIONAL_PASS: score ≥ 60, no critical, has high findings
- FAIL: score < 60 OR critical finding OR blocker
- BLOCKED: run incomplete or no build to evaluate

**Remediation Flow (BA-Driven Fix)**: Report → RemediationManifest → Build Agent (BA) targeted fix. `remediateFromReport()` in runner.ts instantiates a `BuildAgent` ("BA-REMEDIATION-001") and enforces guardrails (BA-G01 through BA-G04) before proceeding.

**Patch-Based Remediation**: `fixFileFromFindings()` uses a two-phase approach: (1) Primary: asks LLM for a JSON patch object (`{ "patches": [{ startLine, endLine, replacement }] }`) — only the specific lines that need fixing are replaced, all other lines stay byte-for-byte identical. File content sent with line numbers for precise targeting. `applyPatches()` validates non-overlapping patches, applies bottom-up to preserve line numbers. (2) Fallback: if patch parsing/application fails, falls back to full-file rewrite with strict instructions to minimize changes. Each fix records its method (`"patch"` or `"fallback_full_rewrite"`) and diff stats (lines added/removed/unchanged).

**Preservation Gates** (5 gates, all must pass before writing to disk):
- PG-SIZE: Fixed file must be 25%–400% of original size
- PG-DIFF-RATIO: No more than 40% of lines can change (surgical, not a rewrite)
- PG-STRUCTURE: No more than 50% of structural declarations (export/function/class/const/interface/type/enum) can disappear
- PG-PREAMBLE: Reject if output starts with LLM preamble (markdown fences, "Here is the fixed file", etc.)
- PG-ENCODING: Reject if output contains null bytes (binary corruption)
If any gate fails, the file is NOT written — original is preserved, status is `"failed"` with gate violation details. All gate results recorded per-file in `FixFileResult.preservationGates`.

**Pre-Write Backup**: Before overwriting any file, `fixUnitsFromFindings()` creates a timestamped backup at `build/remediation_backups/<timestamp>/` preserving relative paths. `rollbackRemediation(runId)` in runner.ts restores all files from the latest backup, re-exports the zip, and clears the remediation block from build_manifest.json.

**Rollback API**: `POST /api/avcs/runs/:certRunId/rollback` — restores pre-remediation state (files + zip + manifest). Blocked if remediation is currently running (409). Frontend "Rollback" button appears after remediation completes.

**BA Guardrails** (all active):
- BA-G01: Registry access blocked (executor_type must be external_build)
- BA-G02: Scope limited to declared targets
- BA-G03: Secrets/PII filter — scans targets for AWS keys, API keys, passwords, private key headers, Bearer tokens, hardcoded tokens via regex
- BA-G04: Scope enforcement — validates all target paths exist within declared unit file list

**Concurrent Lock**: Only one remediation can run per build runId at a time (409 Conflict if duplicate attempted).

**File Inventory Context**: `fixUnitsFromFindings()` scans the live `repo/` directory to build a complete file inventory, passed to LLM for accurate import path fixing. Nearby files + directory listing always included; full file list included for repos ≤500 files.

Post-remediation: `build_manifest.json` updated with remediation summary, `repo_manifest.json` regenerated, `project_repo.zip` repackaged via `repackageExportZip()`. Remediation status tracked in-memory map in `avcs-routes.ts`, polled by frontend every 3s. BUILD_TRANSITIONS: passed → building and exported → building allowed for remediation.

**Data Storage** (`Axion/avcs_data/`): runs/, findings/, evidence/, reports/ — flat JSON files.

**API Endpoints** (`server/avcs-routes.ts`, registered via `registerAVCSRoutes()` in `routes.ts`):
- `POST /api/avcs/runs` — create + plan certification run (assemblyId, runId, runType)

### Axion Analytics Engine (AAE) — Phase 1

AAE is the single source of truth for all platform metrics, cards, counters, and dashboards. No page computes platform truth locally if AAE can serve it.

**Architecture**: Shared TypeScript contracts → PostgreSQL tables → Server engine → REST API → React frontend.

**Shared Contracts** (`shared/analytics/`):
- `event-envelope.ts` — `AnalyticsEventEnvelope` type (canonical event format)
- `metric-registry.ts` — `MetricDefinition` type (metric metadata)
- `snapshot-store.ts` — `MetricSnapshot`, `TrendPoint` types (stored metric values)
- `card-registry.ts` — `CardDefinition`, `AnalyticsCardResponse` types (UI card payloads)
- `api-types.ts` — `AnalyticsApiResponse<T>`, `AnalyticsCommonQuery`, `AnalyticsDimensions`, `BatchCardReadRequest` types (API contracts)
- `index.ts` — barrel export

**Database Tables** (in `shared/schema.ts`):
- `analytics_events` — accepted event envelopes (event_id PK, event_type, domain_id, source_system, payload JSONB, dimensions JSONB, dedupe_key, indexes on domain_id/event_type/occurred_at)
- `analytics_snapshots` — latest metric values (snapshot_id PK, metric_key, window, dimensions_hash, value JSONB, computed_at, freshness_sla_ms, stale flag, unique index on metric_key+window+dimensions_hash)
- `analytics_trends` — bucketed trend history (point_id PK, metric_key, bucket_start/end, granularity, value JSONB, unique index on metric_key+bucket_start+granularity+dimensions_hash)

**Server Engine** (`server/analytics/`):
- `analytics-ingest.ts` — event ingestion: validate envelope, stamp accepted_at, dedupe by event_id, store to analytics_events
- `analytics-registry.ts` — 15 Tier A metric definitions + 14 card definitions (static registries)
- `analytics-snapshots.ts` — snapshot store: compute metric values from pipelineRuns/assemblies tables + events, upsert to analytics_snapshots, freshness/staleness tracking
- `analytics-aggregator.ts` — aggregation logic: count/sum/avg/rate/latest, dimension normalization, window resolution (live/24h/7d/30d)
- `analytics-service.ts` — main facade: getCard(), getCards(), getMetric(), getMetricTrend(), getEngineHealth()
- `analytics-routes.ts` — Express routes registered via `registerAnalyticsRoutes(app)`
- `analytics-seed.ts` — startup seeder: scans existing pipelineRuns/assemblies and backfills snapshots

**API Routes** (all return `AnalyticsApiResponse<T>` envelope):

- Hero strip: engine title, health status (operational badge), stats (metrics/cards/events counts), window selector, refresh
- Platform Overview section: 4 hero cards (Active Runs, Run Success Rate, Gate Failures, System Health)
- Run Lifecycle section: Runs Started, Runs Completed, Failed Runs, Avg Run Duration
- Stage Execution section: Stage Failures, Avg Stage Duration
- Operations section: Active Agents, Verification Rate, Token Cost, Maintenance Executions
- All cards fetched individually via GET /api/analytics/cards/:cardId with window param
- Window selector controls all cards; honest states (loading/stale/empty/error)
